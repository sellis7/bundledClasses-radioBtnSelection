## Group of bundled classes selected by single radio button choice

Simple queries created ("getevents" and "grpCourseInfo") that identify a group of
associated classes, and provide schedule details to display for those courses. A radio button
is designated for each group of classes that triggers the selection of all associated classes
when clicked. If an alternate radio button is chosen, all checkboxes that were selected
are reset and then this new associated group of checkboxes relating to the classes is selected.

*A visual reference of the UI is provided as a JPG file that show the tabluar layout of
the associated classes, and the radio button provided as an option for each group.*
